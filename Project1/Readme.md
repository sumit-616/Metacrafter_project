# NFT Collection Manager

This project provides a simple implementation of an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) collection manager. It allows you to mint new NFTs, list all minted NFTs, and get the total supply of NFTs in your collection. The NFTs have metadata including name, age, occupation, hair color, eye color, creator, and mint date.

## Features

- **Mint NFTs:** Create and store NFTs with specified metadata.
- **List NFTs:** Display the metadata of all minted NFTs.
- **Get Total Supply:** Return the total number of NFTs created.
